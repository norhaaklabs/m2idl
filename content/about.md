My Motto is, If you can’t break it, you don’t own it, If you don’t own it than you are Powned!.

My offer: Strong analytical, problem-solving, computational, and communication skills. Extracurricular activities attest my good ethics and my excellent interpersonal skills.

I’m no religous freak, either you are a believer, atheist or agnositc, I find that everyone of us must strive to make an impact in life.

There is this passage from the holy coran that I found inspiring:

The Table (32)

Because of that We ordained for the Children of Israel: that whoever kills a person—unless it is for murder or corruption on earth—it is as if he killed the whole of mankind; and whoever saves it, it is as if he saved the whole of mankind. Our messengers came to them with clarifications, but even after that, many of them continue to commit excesses in the land.

(32) المائدة

مِنْ أَجْلِ ذَٰلِكَ كَتَبْنَا عَلَىٰ بَنِي إِسْرَائِيلَ أَنَّهُ مَن قَتَلَ نَفْسًا بِغَيْرِ نَفْسٍ أَوْ فَسَادٍ فِي الْأَرْضِ فَكَأَنَّمَا قَتَلَ النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا وَمَنْ أَحْيَاهَا فَكَأَنَّمَا أَحْيَا النَّاسَ جَمِيعًا ۚ وَلَقَدْ جَاءَتْهُمْ رُسُلُنَا بِالْبَيِّنَاتِ ثُمَّ إِنَّ كَثِيرًا مِّنْهُم بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ فِي الْأَرْضِ لَمُسْرِفُونَ

I’ve named my first child Jacob Israel for a reason.

You guessed it then, my mission in life is simple: to help save as much lives as possible. So help me God!
