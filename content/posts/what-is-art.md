What is art? Is a title of a book written by theodor destoivski. It's not as thick as pride and prejeduce. So it makes it a fast and good read. It's essence can be summarized as: Art is the true effective transmission of experience.

Case study; painting by Chaibia Talal (Adraoui).

I had a choice to make. Either sit in an office and go crazy or get out and start writing and talking about my past, current and planned experiences. All into my quest to discover my true  or very human nature and stay as close as I can to the source.

If you are not paying close attention you might end up being a robot (AI-powered)
